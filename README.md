This program was built for a class at my university. I had to create a Python program that connects to a MySQL database. The program had to include a menu of sorts and had to interact with the database using CRUD. I decided to make a program that allows students, instructors, and admins to sign up and enroll in classes, create courses, delete courses, and more. Each role has different abilities throughout the program. I also created the databases connected with this program.
